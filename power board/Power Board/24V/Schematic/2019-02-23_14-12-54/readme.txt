4. Planes will need to be repoured to update the Copper Pour Polygons
	a. Once your board is loaded, select the Tools menu from the
	   top Menu Bar
	b. Scroll to the Polygon Pours item on the Tools Menu.
	c. The Polygon Pours item should expand to show more options
	d. Select Repour All Polygons, this will repour all of the
	   polygons.
5. Your board should be viewable within Altium now.

*******************  LIB Instructions  *******************
**********************************************************

To import your new LIBRARY PARTS into Altium follow these steps:

1. After running the Ultra Librarian export for the first time,
you will need to copy the following files into an area where
they can be accessed for all future translations.  They are script
files that Altium will need to be able to find.
	a. UL_Form.dfm
	b. UL_Form.pas
	c. UL_Import.pas
	d. UL_Import.prjScr
2. The above script file will need to be run from within Altium.
This can be done by going to File, Open and selecting the
UL_Import.PrjScr file stored above.
3. Select the "DXP" dropdown menu in the top-left corner runfrom
the drop down menu and select "Run Script". Select "UL_Form.pas"
and click "OK"
4. When the script is run, it will ask you for the file name of the
Ultra Librarian file to run. Click "File...", select the latest file
produced with a date code (for instance 2010-02-17_23-12-34.txt), and
click "Start Import".
5. The script will open a new Integraged Library project and import
the Ultra Librarian data into it.  When complete a message box
will pop up saying that import is done.
